# The Neutron Electric Dipole Moment Problem

The experimentally measured electric dipole moment of the neutron is far below the theoretical upper limit predicted by the point-like quark model, approaching zero. This observational fact is difficult to explain intuitively within the framework of the Standard Model of Quantum Field Theory (QFT). However, within the shell-layer structure of microscopic particles postulated by this model, this puzzle can be readily resolved:

● Origin of Electric Neutrality: The overall electrical neutrality of the neutron originates from the inter-layer-phase coherence mechanism between its internal quark shells carrying different charges, constituting the overall apparent charge.

● Guarantee of Zero Electric Dipole Moment: The electric dipole moment directly measures the separation degree between the positive and negative charge centers. The multi-layered quasi-spherical symmetric configuration of this model, by its geometric nature, determines that the centers of each layer are nearly overlapping. This intrinsic, extremely high symmetry, determined by the fundamental structure, in principle forbids the emergence of a significant permanent electric dipole moment.

Therefore, the neutron's electric dipole moment being nearly zero is not the result of accidental "fine-tuning," but rather an inevitable geometric attribute of its being a multi-layered SEQ structure. This provides a new approach to solving the strong CP problem, beyond traditional field theory paths.
